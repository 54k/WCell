- added DefaultNPCSpellCooldown, so they won't spam if their spells have no cooldown
- fixed power & rune regeneration (thanks to TOM_RUS!)
- fixed DefaultMeleeCombatDistance (thanks to ZaDarkSide)
- implemented proc'ing of non-damage spell correctly (this fixes Holy Inspiration, Counterspell and some more)
