- fixed periodic aura time display
- removed level up animation from newly spawned creatures
- fixed spell damage calculation (was always doubled for characters, and applied twice if spell was triggered)
- got rid of the tick-based IUpdateObjectAction and replaced them with about equally efficient but much more precise timers
