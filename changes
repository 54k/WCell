- fixed gathering skills
- added log message for new items again, now also shown if item is added to existing stacks
- fixed #npc goto to coincide with the new way, #npc spawn works -> Create instance if not owning one that contains the NPC
- if an instance is created through a command, everyone in the GM's group who is not staff, gets kicked
