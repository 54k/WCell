- fixed the stormlib 32/64 bit issue
- changed timer and general delta arguments from float seconds to int millis
-> This changed the chaos that was the timer code into a pleasant and consistent API
- made more use of object pools
- fixed regeneration, as well as a multitude of timer- and timer-related- bugs / some minor pet bugs
